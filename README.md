Boilerplate
-------------

An opinionated default boiler plate project for basic static websites without framework or templating dependencies and using just npm as the build manager/task runner.

* npm is used for managing dependencies and as the overall build manager
* webpack as the js management and build tool
* imageoptim cli for optimisation of images (the pay for app jpegmini is not called)
* sizzle is included by default for the basics
* jquery is included but webpack and module selection can be used to minimise cruft

Instructions
